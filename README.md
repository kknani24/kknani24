# ðŸ’» Tech Stack

As a student, every new tool or language I learn feels like adding a new weapon to my coding arsenal. Here's a peek into my ever-growing tech toolkit:

### Languages & Frameworks
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/r-%23276DC3.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=r&logoColor=white) ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

Python was my first love, and it's still my go-to for almost everything. There's something magical about how a few lines of Python can bring a complex AI concept to life. R threw me for a loop at first (pun intended!), but now I appreciate its statistical prowess. C and C++ felt like going back to the basics, but man, the speed! Java and JavaScript? They're teaching me that good code can run anywhere, from big servers to tiny browsers.

### Web & App Development

Who knew that AI models could have such cool web interfaces? Certainly not me when I started! But here I am, building web apps to showcase my ML projects:

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white) ![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/django-%23092E20.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white) ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-%23000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white) ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-005571?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastapi) ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

HTML and CSS were like learning to paint, but with code. React made me feel like a wizard, updating web pages with a flick of state. Django? It's like Python decided to build a city. And Flask? It's my trusty sidekick for quick API prototypes. I'm still wrapping my head around Next.js and Express, but every small win feels huge!

### Data Science & ML

This is where the magic happens! Each library opens up new possibilities, and I'm like a kid with new Lego sets:

![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) ![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-%23ffffff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Matplotlib&logoColor=black) ![Scipy](https://img.shields.io/badge/SciPy-%230C55A5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scipy&logoColor=%white) ![Keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keras-%23D00000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Keras&logoColor=white) ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-%23EE4C2C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white) ![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-%23FF6F00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=TensorFlow&logoColor=white) ![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white) ![Plotly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly-%233F4F75.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=plotly&logoColor=white) ![mlflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/mlflow-%23d9ead3.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=blue)

NumPy arrays felt weird at first, but now I can't imagine life without them. Pandas makes me feel like a data detective, uncovering insights in messy datasets. Matplotlib and Plotly turn boring numbers into stories - I spent way too much time playing with color schemes! TensorFlow and PyTorch were intimidating giants, but now they're powerful allies in my ML adventures. And scikit-learn? It's like a Swiss Army knife for ML - there's a tool for everything!

### Databases & Cloud

Diving into databases and cloud computing has been like discovering a whole new world beneath the surface:

![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-4479A1.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) ![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white) ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white) ![Azure](https://img.shields.io/badge/azure-%230072C6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoftazure&logoColor=white)

MongoDB made me rethink what a database could be - goodbye rigid tables, hello flexible documents! MySQL feels like the wise old sage of databases. SQLite is my trusty companion for quick projects. As for AWS and Azure? They're like vast oceans of computing power. I'm just learning to swim, but the potential is breathtaking!

### Design Tools

Because sometimes, your AI project needs to look good too:

![Adobe Photoshop](https://img.shields.io/badge/adobe%20photoshop-%2331A8FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20photoshop&logoColor=white) ![Adobe Lightroom](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Lightroom-31A8FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20Lightroom&logoColor=white) ![Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Lightroom%20Classic-31A8FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20Lightroom%20Classic&logoColor=white) ![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro-9999FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro&logoColor=white) ![Adobe After Effects](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20After%20Effects-9999FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20After%20Effects&logoColor=white) ![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white) ![Canva](https://img.shields.io/badge/Canva-%2300C4CC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Canva&logoColor=white)

Photoshop makes me feel like a digital artist, even if I'm just creating ML project banners. Premiere Pro and After Effects? They're turning my ML demos into mini-movies! Figma has been a game-changer for designing UI/UX for my AI applications. And Canva? It's my secret weapon for making quick, good-looking presentations about my latest AI experiments.

### Tools & Environments

The unsung heroes of my coding adventures:

![PowerShell](https://img.shields.io/badge/PowerShell-%235391FE.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&logoColor=white) ![Windows Terminal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows%20Terminal-%234D4D4D.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows-terminal&logoColor=white) ![GithubPages](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%20pages-121013?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)

PowerShell and Windows Terminal have become my trusty command centers. And GitHub Pages? It's like magic - suddenly, my projects have a home on the web!

# ðŸŽ“ Education

My journey in AI and ML isn't just about coding - it's a whole new way of thinking:

- Currently pursuing a Computer Science degree, with a focus on AI and ML. Each class feels like unlocking a new piece of the puzzle.
- Online courses have become my second classroom. Coursera, edX, fast.ai - my browser history is a testament to my learning addiction!
- Personal projects are my playground. From a chatbot that tells dad jokes to a neural network that tries to generate cat pictures (with hilarious results), each project teaches me something new.

# ðŸš€ Goals

The world of AI is vast, and I'm just getting started:

- Contribute to open-source AI and ML projects. The idea of my code helping other developers gives me goosebumps!
- Participate in AI/ML competitions. Kaggle, here I come! (Even if I end up in the bottom half of the leaderboard, I'll learn tons!)
- Land an internship in AI or Data Science. The thought of working alongside seasoned pros makes me both excited and nervous.
- Build a killer portfolio. I want my GitHub to tell the story of my AI journey, one commit at a time.

Every day in this field brings new challenges moments. I'm on a mission to turn my passion for AI and ML into a career that pushes the boundaries of what's possible. Join me on this adventure!
